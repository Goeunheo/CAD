# CAD
During my undergraduate studies, I took a Project Design course, where we selected a single topic and carried out its design over the course of a semester. The class aimed to help students understand fundamental design concepts and integrate various design elements, thereby building essential engineering design skills. For our team project, we developed a novel car door system that lifts upward instead of the conventional swing-open mechanism. We conducted extensive brainstorming, preliminary research, and 3D modeling, while considering factors such as operation mechanism, cost-effectiveness, feasibility, and safety. As a result, we successfully created an efficient sliding door system.
